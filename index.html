   				<h3>General Grievous</h3>
   			   <h1>About Me.</h1>
   			
   			   <p class="lead">General Grievous is a brilliant Separatist military strategist and a feared Jedi hunter, known for his ruthlessness and hacking cough. His body itself was a weapon, allowing him lightning quick strikes and devastating blows. But he was also quick to run from a fight, a tactic that worked until one final meeting with Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>

		            <p>A native of the planet Kalee, Grievous sustained severe injuries that required extensive repair by the time of the Clone Wars. Willingly submitting to a procedure that rendered him more mechanical than organic, he became a living weapon, granting him lightning-quick reflexes and devastating strength. Although he was neither Jedi or Sith, nor even sensitive to the power of the Force, Grievous was a skilled lightsaber duelist, having trained in the art of the lightsaber under the fallen Jedi Master-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. Known for his hatred of the Jedi Order, Grievous killed Jedi over the course of the war, and would claim their lightsabers both as trophies and weapons to be used against other opponents, be they Jedi or clone troopers. The cyborg, nicknamed the "head clanker" by the Republic clones due to his cybernetics and role as Confederate Supreme Commander, became one of the Republic's priority targets.

				</div> <!-- end bgrid -->
				<div class="bgrid service-item animate-this">	
		            <p>In addition to his combat skills, Grievous was a brilliant military strategist who oversaw multiple campaigns throughout the Clone Wars—from the Battle of Kamino, where he failed to halt the production line of clone troopers; to the Battle of Dathomir, where his battle droids massacred the Nightsisters led by the witch Mother Talzin. In 19 BBY, Grievous launched a daring raid on Coruscant, the Republic capital world, resulting in the abduction of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. However, the Jedi succeeded in rescuing the Chancellor while driving back the Separatist invaders. Following the loss of Dooku, Grievous and his army went into hiding in the Outer Rim Territories. Unknown to Grievous, his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, betrayed the general's location to the Jedi Order, allowing them to invade the planet Utapau in an effort to bring a swift and decisive conclusion to the war. As a result, Grievous was ultimately slain by his nemesis, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose 212th Attack Battalion went on to secure Utapau even as Order 66 went into effect, marking the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire.

							<h4>Early Life</h4>
							<p>The son of his mother and father, Grievous, then known as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a male Kaleesh from the planet Kalee. Since his childhood, he worshiped the warlords of Kalee, watching them return home with spoils of war from conquered peoples. In time, he, experiencing a rapid rise to the rank, became a feared warlord and warrior. Grievous learned battle tactics and warfare during the Kalee's war against the Yam'rii of Huk, and eventually developed a personal vendetta against the Galactic Republic, as the government had supported the Yam'rii. After becoming a warlord, the Kaleesh warrior embarked on conquests throughout space, but he came to realize the protectors of the Republic, the Jedi Order, were nearly undefeatable in duels, holding supernatural abilities through the energy field known as the Force. He developed a hate towards the Jedi.</p>

							<h4>Grievous becomes cyborg</h4>
							<p>Grievous chose to become a cyborg, receiving his enhancements over time, after the Sith, the ancient enemies of the Jedi, offered them to him, as they had been researching into cybernetically enhanced individuals. He chose to receive extreme cybernetic upgrades to increase his skills in combat, becoming an even more threatening and fearsome warrior. Following a gruesome shuttle crash that almost killed him and destroyed most of his original body, he was nearly entirely rebuilt with cybernetics. With his living Kaleesh flesh traded for cyborg implants, Grievous claimed that his changes were improvements. As recounted in one legend, when Grievous's transformation was occurring over time, he initially only made simple enhancements before moving onto more extreme changes. The legend said Grievous transformed himself because he admired the logic of droids and wanted to mirror their infallibility, strength, and power.</p>

							<h4>The Malevolence campaign</h4>
							<p>Grievous was known to lead Confederate starfleets to further his conquest of Republic planets, with his ships leaving the worlds wrecked and burned. As he was leading the Separatist forces in the Clone Wars, Grievous gained the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser, Malevolence, as his flagship. From the Malevolence's bridge, Grievous could command millions of battle droids, and he used his new warship in the Malevolence campaign, where he executed attacks on Republic fleets that left no survivors. While stationed in the Abregado system with Count Dooku aboard, a Republic fleet led by Jedi Master Plo Koon and Clone Commander "Wolffe" aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Triumphant arrived in the system to engage the warship. </p>

							<h4>Grievous Proves his competence</h4>
							<p>Later in the war, Grievous was instructed by his master to return to his fortress on the third moon of Vassek. When he arrived, he found that his MagnaGuards had been deactivated. Count Dooku, having laid a trap for the general in order to test his abilities, lured the Jedi and clones to Grievous's fortress. With the Jedi having infiltrated the base and with his bodyguards deactivated, the Count had hoped to punish Grievous for his recent failures. In the fight that ensued, Grievous was damaged and his pet roggwart Gor, was killed. However, he was soon repaired by his droid EV-A4-D, and continued on his hunt for the Jedi. Grievous eventually caught up with them and dispatched the remaining clone forces. Grievous then engaged Padawan Nahdar Vebb in a fierce duel; due to his multiple limbs, Grievous easily killed Vebb with a dirty, but well-timed blaster shot. Fisto saw the duel and his former apprentice's death on video, along with Grievous threatening and intimidating him.</p>

							<h4>The Clone Wars</h4>
							<p>After Grievous received his cybernetic enhancements and was trained in lightsaber combat by Count Dooku, he became the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies and gained the rank of general in the military of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The CIS and Republic were launched into the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars with the Battle of Geonosis, which Grievous took part in. While it was entirely by accident, the now-cyborg Grievous's first clash against members of the Jedi Order came during the battle. He was in the Geonosian Stalgasin hive's catacombs when the battle began, and the cyborg fought a number of Jedi during his retreat. Grievous left none of the Force-sensitives he encountered alive, meaning his involvement in the war's opening battle was not discovered until much later. The war proceeded to spread throughout the galaxy, so Grievous and his forces engaged the Grand Army of the Republic, and, under his command, the Separatist Droid Army attacked Republic planets. As the Separatist Army's leader, Grievous would cause fear throughout the Republic, although the Confederate populace were not told the stories of the General's onslaughts. Ultimately, as a number of Republic citizens—as well as some citizens in CIS territory—saw Dooku as noble yet misguided, many came to see Grievous as the true face of the Confederacy.</p>

							<h4>Capturing the Jedi Temple</h4>
							<p>At some point during the war, General Grievous managed to ambush Jedi Master Eeth Koth's flagship. Grievous boarded the vessel with a force of battle droids and confronted Koth on the ship's bridge, where he revealed he had been looking forward to meeting the Jedi Master. Koth noted that Grievous's reputation, that of a murderer and coward, preceded him, Grievous disagreed and asked whether it was murder to kill the Jedi before kicking Koth back. The two began a brief, but intense duel, and, after Koth managed to Force push Grievous into a viewport, the General's MagnaGuards shocked Koth. Attacked from Grievous in the front and from the MagnaGuards from behind, Koth was defeated.</p>

                  <p>
					As the droid army leader in the Clone Wars, General Grievous inspired fear throughout the Republc. Trained in lightsaber combat by Count Dooku, he travelled the galaxy, invading worlds and engaging Jedi. The metal-meets-organic monstrosity fought Ahsoka Tano and Obi-Wan Kenobi numerous times, always managing to escape.
</p></li>

<li><h1>Grievous Escapes</h1><img src="images/avatars/genh2.jpg" alt="">
					<p>Grievous maintained his own lair in a Separatist headquarters. Located on the third moon of Vassek, it contained several rooms and chambers, featuring statues of an alien warrior and multiple armors. The lair was discovered by investigating Jedi and clones, who surprised the General and demanded his surrender. While he suffered severe injuries, Grievous escaped and was restored by his doctor, A-4D; he regrouped to unleash a surprise of his own on the Jedi: Gor, his vicious pet roggwart. While Gor was destroyed, Grievous himself killed a young Padawan called Nahdar and overwhelmed Kit Fisto in lightsaber combat. The General survived to fight another day."

               <li><h1>Grievous kidnapps Palpatine</h1><img src="images/avatars/genh3.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
					Under the orders of Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, General Grievous led a daring kidnapping of Chancellor Palpatine in the Battle of Coruscant. Keeping his prisoner in the custody of Dooku aboard his flagship, Grievous was unsurprised when Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker arrived to stage a rescue. The Jedi proved victorious, with Anakin killing Dooku and freeing the Chancellor, but were soon apprehended by Grievous’ droids. Brought before him, Grievous took their lightsabers, boasting that they would make a fine addition to his collection. Thanks to some of R2-D2’s clever trickery, however, the Jedi regained their weapons and cornered the droid army leader. In a last-second cowardly move, Grievous shattered the bridge viewport and escaped into space.

				   <h1>Battle of Uttapu</h1><img src="images/avatars/genp.jpg" alt="">
				   <p>Grievous headed for a major Separatist base on Utapau. Speaking with Darth Sidious, he was assured that the war was coming to an end, and the Separatists would be victorious. Still, it would prove to be short-lived comfort for the walking terror. Obi-Wan soon arrived with a battalion of clones, and the Battle of Utapau began. The General and Obi-Wan dueled, and despite wielding four lightsabers at once, Grievous was dismembered and once again tried to flee. Obi-Wan gave chase, and the two eventually fought in a knock-down drag-out fist fight. The Jedi had lost his lightsaber and found himself dangling from a cliff, and Grievous appeared to have the upper hand. As the General menacingly lurched forward, prepared to deliver the final blow, Obi-Wan used the Force to draw Grievous' blaster into his hand. He shot Grievous in the chest, igniting what remained of his organic matter, and the fearsome menace was no more.</p>
